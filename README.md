#Some notes on implementation

Used a git to version control my work. (Note used a Private repo).
This project was setup like most for me. I created a Gruntfile for perfoming tasks. (Build, Minify, Compile) etc....

In this case all my gruntfile does in compile my sass. 

Note: I have included, my pre-complied sass and generated sass. Sass in src directory and compiled css in public directory. 

I have also included my gruntfile and other components I used in my setup.
